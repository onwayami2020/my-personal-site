In its ruling of 12 May 1998 the Hamburg Regional Court ruled that a person whose web pages contain links to third-party pages may be held responsible for the content of those third-party pages. This liability can only be avoided through an explicit disclaimer. To this effect, despite careful checking of their content, I cannot accept any liability for the content of external linked pages, which do not in themselves represent a service provided by Kabiru Maitama Kura. The providers of the pages to which I provide links are exclusively responsible for the content of those linked pages. Should the content of those pages in any way contravene civil or criminal law, Kabiru Maitama Kura naturally disassociates himself explicitly from such content and in no respect adopts it as his own.
