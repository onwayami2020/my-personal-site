abstract: <div class=text-justify>  Several factors have been suggested to explain why employees engage in deviant behaviour at the workplace. To date, some of the factors that have been considered include perceived organisational politics perceived organizational justice, organizational trust, group cohesiveness and group identity, among others. Despite these studies, however, few studies have attempted to consider the influence of organisational formal controls and perceived group norms on workplace deviance. Even if any, they have reported conflicting findings. Therefore, a moderating variable is suggested. This paper proposes self-regulatory efficacy as potential moderator on the relationship between organisational formal controls, perceived group norms and workplace deviance. </div>
