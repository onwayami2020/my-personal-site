	abstract = {The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of compensation, training and development and manager support on commitment level of hotel employees and the moderating role of co-worker support in the service context. The study used a cross-sectional and quantitative mail survey approach. Hotel employees in Malaysia were surveyed, and Partial Least Squares Method, Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM) algorithm and bootstrap techniques were used to measure the relationships between compensation, training and development, manager support and employee commitment and the moderating role of co-worker support on the relationships between compensation, training and development, manager support and employee commitment. The results confirm that co-worker support moderates the relationships between compensation, training and development, manager support and employee commitment level. The findings provide new theoretical knowledge about the moderating effect of the co-worker support and significantly enhance knowledge about employee commitment and loyalty. The research provides notable insights into the role of social and structural bonding in hotel employees’ commitment and loyalty in the service, as well as provides an important implication for segmentation. These results can be used by hospitality managers to gain competitive advantage over its rivals. The study contributes to research on employees’ commitment and loyalty. Introducing the role of co-worker support as a moderator within the context of a hotel industry is new in the services marketing literature.  },
