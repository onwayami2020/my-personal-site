abstract: <div class=text-justify> In today?s highly competitive market environment, customer relationship management has become a key strategy for personalizing customer experience, improving customer satisfaction, as well as building and maintaining loyalty. The present study investigates the relationship between customer relationship management dimensions and behavioral intentions. Key customer focus, customer relationship management organization, knowledge management, and technology-based customer relationship management are conceptualized as dimensions of customer relationship management. Results, based on a convenience sample of 363 customers of a full-fledged Islamic bank in Nigeria, support the hypothesized model. Specifically, the results show that key customer focus, customer relationship management organization, knowledge management, and technology-based customer relationship management are related to behavioral intentions. Practical implications of these findings and suggestions for future research are discussed. </div>
