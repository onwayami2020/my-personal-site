abstract: Drawing on social learning and self-efficacy theories, the purpose of this paper is to examine links among perceived workgroup norms, self-regulatory efficacy, and deviant workplace behaviours. Faculty members from universities located in the northwest geopolitical zone of Nigeria participated. Partial least squares path modelling tested moderation of self-regulatory efficacy on the relationship between perceived workgroup norms and deviant workplace behaviours.Findings suggest a positive relationship between perceived descriptive norms and deviant workplace behaviours. A hypothesised effect of perceived injunctive norms on deviant workplace behaviours was not supported. Results also suggest interaction terms representing perceived descriptive norms and self-regulatory efficacy are significant. Similar results regarding moderation of self-regulatory efficacy on the relationship between perceived injunctive norms and deviant workplace behaviours were found. Findings support the view that self-regulatory efficacy overrides predispositions individuals hold to engage in deviant workplace behaviours. Research limitations/implications A cross-sectional design did not allow causal inferences, and self-report data associate with common method variance and social-desirability bias Individual factors should be considered during selection in Nigerian universities. Moderation of self-regulatory efficacy suggests self-regulation minimises individual engagement in deviant acts. Thus, human resources managers in Nigerian universities should consider self regulatory efficacy as a selection criterion when hiring academicians. This can be achieved by conducting personality inventory tests to screen those whose values are incompatible. Although extant research on organisational socialisation demonstrates mix findings regarding the link between perceived workgroup norms and deviant workbehaviours, this study tests whether self-regulatory efficacy addresses these inconsistencies.
