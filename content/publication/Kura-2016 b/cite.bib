	abstract = {Purpose Drawing on social learning and self-efficacy theories, the purpose of this paper is to examine links among perceived workgroup norms, self-regulatory efficacy, and deviant workplace behaviours. Design/methodology/approach Faculty members from universities located in the northwest geopolitical zone of Nigeria participated. Partial least squares path modelling tested moderation of self-regulatory efficacy on the relationship between perceived workgroup norms and deviant workplace behaviours. Findings Findings suggest a positive relationship between perceived descriptive norms and deviant workplace behaviours. A hypothesised effect of perceived injunctive norms on deviant workplace behaviours was not supported. Results also suggest interaction terms representing perceived descriptive norms and self-regulatory efficacy are significant. Similar results regarding moderation of self-regulatory efficacy on the relationship between perceived injunctive norms and deviant workplace behaviours were found. Findings support the view that self-regulatory efficacy overrides predispositions individuals hold to engage in deviant workplace behaviours. Research limitations/implications A cross-sectional design did not allow causal inferences, and self-report data associate with common method variance and social-desirability bias. Practical implications Individual factors should be considered during selection in Nigerian universities. Moderation of self-regulatory efficacy suggests self-regulation minimises individual engagement in deviant acts. Thus, human resources managers in Nigerian universities should consider self-regulatory efficacy as a selection criterion when hiring academicians. This can be achieved by conducting personality inventory tests to screen those whose values are incompatible. Originality/value Although extant research on organisational socialisation demonstrates mix findings regarding the link between perceived workgroup norms and deviant work behaviours, this study tests whether self-regulatory efficacy addresses these inconsistencies.},
