abstract: <div class=text-justify>  The construct of graduate employability (GE) has received considerable attention from researchers and practitioners because of its crucial role in national economic agendas. Previous research is mixed in terms of the association between psychological capital (PsyCap) and GE. This represents a significant theoretical gap in the literature. To address this knowledge gap and better understand the relationship, we proposed grit as the potential “moderator” between PsyCap and GE. By incorporating grit as moderator, this paper aims to contribute to concept and theory development in the field of educational management. The paper provides valuable insights that support the notion that PsyCap and grit acquisition enhance GE. </div>
