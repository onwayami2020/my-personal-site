   abstract = {This study investigated the influence of group norms and self-regulatory efficacy on workplace deviant behaviour. A web-based survey was used to collect data from 217 teaching staff from various higher education institutions in Nigeria. The data collected was analysed using Partial Least Squares (PLS) path modeling. As predicted, the path coefficient results supported the direct influence of perceived injunctive norms and self-regulatory efficacy on organisational deviance. Similarly, perceived injunctive norm and self-regulatory efficacy were found to be significant predictors of interpersonal deviance. On the contrary, perceived descriptive norms were not significant predictors of both organisational deviance and interpersonal deviance. In addition, self-regulatory efficacy does not moderate the relationship between perceived descriptive norms and organisational deviance. We also found support for the moderating role of self-regulatory efficacy on the relationship between perceived injunctive norms and dimensions of workplace deviance. The moderating role of self-regulatory efficacy on the relationship between perceived descriptive norms and interpersonal deviance was also supported. Finally, the policy implications of the study are discussed.},
