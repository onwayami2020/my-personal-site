abstract = {The Oxford COVID-19 Vaccine Hesitancy Scale is a 7-item psychometric scale developed by Freeman and colleagues a year after detecting the first case of the disease in 2019. The scale assesses people's thoughts, feelings, and behavior toward COVID-19 vaccines. A comprehensive search of major electronic databases, including Scopus, Clarivate Analytics, and PubMed, was conducted to extract eligible articles for inclusion in this meta-analysis. This paper reports information on data collected for a reliability generalization meta-analysis of the Oxford COVID-19 Vaccine Hesitancy Scale. The dataset incorporates information on the average reliability of the scale as measured with Cronbach's alpha in 20 studies included in the meta-analysis. Several benefits can be derived from the dataset. In particular, the research community would find this dataset beneficial as it can enhance their understanding of the health challenges of COVID-19, helping them come up with better solutions to eradicate the disease.}
