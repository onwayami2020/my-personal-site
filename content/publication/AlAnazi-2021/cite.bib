	abstract = {Does organisational innovation play a mediating role in change-oriented leadership -organizational performance relationship? To address this question, we drew from a resource-based view to examine the mediating role of organisational innovation in the relationship between change-oriented leadership and organizational performance. The resource-based view supported our research model. Given that the unit of analysis is an organisation. 219 principal officers, including Presidents Rectors, Vice Presidents/Vice-Rectors, Registrars. and Deans, were invited to complete the survey on behalf of their universities. Results of the partial least squares structural equation modelling confirmed the positive relationship between change-oriented leadership and university performance. The results provide evidence that organisational innovation directly facilitates university performance. As expected, the relationship between change-oriented leadership and university performance was found to be mediated by organisational innovation. Overall, this study successfully modelled organisational innovation as an underlying mechanism behind the change-oriented leadership -university performance relationship, thereby by testing resource-based theory in Saudi Arabian context. From a practical perspective, results suggest that to improve their performance is imperative for executive leaders in Saudi universities to focus on several specific work design strategies, obtaining feedback about their change-oriented leadership style from followers. While there has been a considerable amount of research emphasising the importance of change-oriented leadership, there has been little research linking this fundamental aspect of leadership to organizational performance. Yet an understanding of the possible mechanisms behind this linkage has not received attention.  },
