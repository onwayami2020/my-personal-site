abstract: <div class=text-justify>  Drawing upon self-efficacy theory, organisational control theory, and social learning theory, this study examined the role of self-regulatory efficacy in buffering the effects of organizational formal control and perceived workgroup norms on deviant workplace behaviour. A total of 265 academics from universities located in the northwest geopolitical zone of Nigeria participated in the study. Results supported the hypothesized direct effects of organizational formal control and perceived workgroup norms on deviant workplace behaviour. In addition, self-regulatory efficacy moderated these relationships. Specifically, there was a stronger negative relationship between perceived behavioural control and interpersonal deviance for individuals with high as opposed to low levels of self-regulatory efficacy. Similar result regarding the moderating effect of self-regulatory efficacy on the relationship between perceived behavioural control and organisational deviance was found. Furthermore, the findings indicated a weaker positive relationship between perceived descriptive norms and interpersonal deviance for individuals with high as opposed to low levels of self-regulatory efficacy. Similarly, results indicated that the relationship between perceived descriptive norm and organisational deviance was less positive for individuals with high self-regulatory efficacy as opposed to low levels of self-regulatory efficacy. Finally, the relationship between perceived injunctive norms and organisational deviance was weaker for individuals with high self-regulatory efficacy than it was for individuals with low self-regulatory efficacy. In general, these findings supported the view that self- regulatory efficacy can override predispositions of individuals to engage in deviant workplace behaviour. Theoretical, methodological and practical implications are discussed. </div>
