summary:
abstract: "<div class=text-justify> ADANCO (“advanced analysis of composites”) is a user-friendly software for variance-based structural equation modeling (Henseler et al., 2015; Reinartz, et al., 2009; SEM).The software can be used to implement “partial least squares path modeling (PLS),   consistent PLS (PLSc), confirmatory composite analysis (CCA),   extraction of the first principal component (PCA), ordinary least squares regression (OLS), sum scores, canonical correlation analysis, and bootstrapping (Henseler et al., 2017, p.1). This one-day workshop is aimed at providing a profound introduction to statistical analysis using ADANCO Software. The course has been designed for PhD students who are interested in learning how to use ADANCO Software in their own research applications. A basic knowledge of multivariate statistics and SEM techniques is helpful, but not required. The session will cover theory and its application. Specifically, theoretical explanations underlying the software procedures and practical exercises where participants will apply their learning to real-world examples provided by the instructor.</div>"
