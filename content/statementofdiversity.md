**Statement of Contribution to Diversity, Equity and Inclusion**:

<div class=text-justify> 

My journey toward contributing to diversity, equity and inclusion began a decade before I had the opportunity to become a lecturer at the polytechnic in one of the educationally underrepresented states in Nigeria. For instance, as an early career teacher, I had two students with special educational needs in my commerce class. To help these students fully achieve their potential, I employed inclusive teaching and assessment strategies, such as providing extra time for in-class activities, quizzes, and examinations.

Since then, I have actively mentored and advised junior colleagues and students from underrepresented and underserved groups. In my mentoring and advising capacities, I encouraged my students to think about the best they can do to promote diversity, equity and inclusion in their current and future roles. I also published numerous articles in scholarly journals about understanding and managing diversity in the workplace. In addition, I have successfully attended a few training programs on diversity, equity and inclusion to keep myself abreast of developments in the field.

Finally, I plan to strengthen my commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion, as mentioned above, by recruiting students, particularly from underrepresented and underserved populations. I will strive to create an open, inclusive, transparent, and equitable environment where these students can comfortably approach me for mentoring and academic advising.
