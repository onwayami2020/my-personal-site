**Statement of Contribution to Diversity, Equity and Inclusion**:

<div class=text-justify> 

My journey toward contributing to diversity, equity and inclusion began a decade before I had the opportunity to become a lecturer at the polytechnic in one of the educationally underrepresented states in Nigeria. For instance, as an early career teacher, I had two students with special educational needs in my commerce class. To help these students fully achieve their potential, I employed inclusive teaching and assessment strategies, such as providing extra time for in-class activities, quizzes, and examinations.

Since then, I have actively mentored and advised junior colleagues and students from underrepresented and underserved groups. In my mentoring and advising capacities, I encouraged my students to think about the best they can do to promote diversity, equity and inclusion in their current and future roles. I also published numerous articles in scholarly journals about understanding and managing diversity in the workplace. In addition, I have successfully attended a few training programs on diversity, equity and inclusion to keep myself abreast of developments in the field.

Finally, I plan to strengthen my commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion, as mentioned above, by recruiting students, particularly from underrepresented and underserved populations. I will strive to create an open, inclusive, transparent, and equitable environment where these students can comfortably approach me for mentoring and academic advising. 

**My Teaching Philosophy**:
  
My teaching philosophy revolves around Benjamin Franklin's famous  quote: "Tell me, and I forget, teach me, and I may remember, involve me, and I learn." Consistent with this inspirational quote, I believe that an interactive teaching strategy is more understandable and facilitates student participation in learning activities (Rosli et al., 2022). Specifically, I motivate my students to pursue lifelong learning by exposing them to current issues and trends in Human Resource Management (HRM) and Organizational behavior. 

I also encourage them to apply their knowledge to real-world situations by providing them with opportunities for experiential learning, such as case studies, role plays, field trips, internships, and online global classroom learning. Additionally, I am committed to delivering supportive mentoring to all my students by offering them career guidance or academic advice, including assisting on how to adjust to academic life during their first year at university, helping them in choosing the right courses, and monitoring their progress

As a researcher and academician, I am committed to enhancing my professional development by keeping abreast of new HRM research and practice developments. I regularly reflect on my teaching philosophy and revise it based on new insights or challenges. I also seek feedback from my students on improving my teaching effectiveness.

Taken together, my teaching philosophy reflects that I have a strong passion for HRM/ Organizational behavior and dedication to student success. By adopting this philosophy, I hope to contribute positively to the teaching, supervising, and mentoring of future HRM leaders who can make a difference in their organizations and society.
