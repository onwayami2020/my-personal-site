**Statement of Contribution to Diversity, Equity and Inclusion**:

<div class=text-justify> 

My journey toward contributing to diversity, equity and inclusion began a decade before I had the opportunity to become a lecturer at the polytechnic in one of the educationally underrepresented states in Nigeria. For instance, as an early career teacher, I had two students with special educational needs in my commerce class. To help these students fully achieve their potential, I employed inclusive teaching and assessment strategies, such as providing extra time for in-class activities, quizzes, and examinations.

Since then, I have actively mentored and advised junior colleagues and students from underrepresented and underserved groups. In my mentoring and advising capacities, I encouraged my students to think about the best they can do to promote diversity, equity and inclusion in their current and future roles. I also published numerous articles in scholarly journals about understanding and managing diversity in the workplace. In addition, I have successfully attended a few training programs on diversity, equity and inclusion to keep myself abreast of developments in the field.

Finally, I plan to strengthen my commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion, as mentioned above, by recruiting students, particularly from underrepresented and underserved populations. I will strive to create an open, inclusive, transparent, and equitable environment where these students can comfortably approach me for mentoring and academic advising. 

**My Teaching Philosophy**:
  
My teaching philosophy is centred on fostering an inclusive and engaging learning environment where students can develop the skills, knowledge, and confidence necessary for success in the field. I believe that education is not just about imparting knowledge but also about preparing students for the challenges and opportunities of the real world. In this spirit, my teaching philosophy is guided by several fundamental principles:

Encouraging active participation and critical thinking: I believe that the active participation of students in the learning activities would help them to learn better. For this reason, I do my best to create a condusive learning environment where students feel motivated to think critically, ask challenging questions, and share their thoughts on the topic under discussion. I also place a strong emphasis on the application of theoretical concepts to real-world situations. Through active participation and critical thinking, students can better understand and internalise the course material and develop problem-solving and decision-making skills.

Developing and revising a practical and relevant curriculum: I believe education is most valuable when appropriate and applicable to students' future careers. To that end, I strive to ensure that the course material and assignments I provide are directly relevant to the curriculum. I also incorporate real-world case studies, industry experts, and other practical examples into my in-class activities to help students see the practical applications of their learning.

Developing professional skills: In addition to technical knowledge, I believe that it is crucial for my students to develop skills and competencies needed by employers, such as leadership competencies, problem-solving skills, teamwork skills, and interpersonal skills. To help my students develop these skills, I provide several in-class activities and assignments using a case study approach. By developing these skills, my students will be better prepared to succeed in their future careers, regardless of their chosen path.

Fostering a supportive and inclusive learning environment: I believe a positive and inclusive learning environment is essential for student success. To that end, I try to create an equitable and inclusive learning environment to help my students realise their carrier goals, regardless of their socio-demographic characteristics, affiliations, and cultural backgrounds. This includes promoting active listening, encouraging open communication, and providing opportunities for students to work together in small groups. By fostering a supportive and inclusive learning environment, I strive to help my students build strong relationships and create a community of learners that can support and challenge each other in their academic and professional journeys.

In conclusion, my goal as a teaching faculty is to provide a comprehensive and engaging learning experience that prepares my students for success in the field. Through a focus on active participation, critical thinking, practical relevance, professional skill development, and a supportive and inclusive learning environment, I am committed to helping my students grow as individuals, as professionals, and as leaders of tomorrow.
